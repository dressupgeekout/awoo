# awoo

Awoo is a textboard engine based on the Sinatra micro-framework

You'll need the `sinatra`, `sinatra-contrib`, `mysql2`, and `rerun` gems, as
well as a mysql server set up using the `create.sql` file.

Running `sudo make install` will make a user named `awoo`, copy `src` to
`/opt/awoo`, set up your database and put a service file in
/etc/systemd/system so you can run `sudo systemctl start awoo` to start the
server on port 8080


## Tests

To run tests, you'll need the server already running, you can adjust the
host and port in `src/test/generic_test.rb` but it defaults to
`127.0.0.1:8080`. It will use the /test board and expects three janitors,
`test`, who moderates /test and is not a moderator, `test2`, who moderates
/test and IS a moderator, and `test3`, who does not moderate test

If you want to test against a production environment but are worried about
security, you can change their passwords, the values used when logging in
are pulled from config.json

The tests depend on the `http-cookie` gem

## Todo List

- On `/ip/:addr`, maybe let people select more than one board at a time to
  ban the IP from?
